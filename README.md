> I was inspired to make this project because MMA and combat sports are one of my favorite things to watch. During the Bright Paths Program I’ve been working on assessments during the weekends and have missed or forgotten about many MMA events so, I made this project thinking about a good way to update myself and other users on the happenings of the latest UFC events.
