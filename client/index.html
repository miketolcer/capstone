    Deiveson Figueiredo by Technical Submission (Rear-Naked Choke) at 4:48 of round one. He improves to 19-1-0 and becomes the new UFC Flyweight Champion.
    Itâ€™s been a long road to the gold for Figueiredo, who had already defeated Joseph Benavidez back in February but failed to capture the belt because he missed weight for the fight. Five months later, the Brazilian returned for a rematch with Benavidez. But this time, he made the 125-pound limit and then proceeded to have an even better performance, stopping Benavidez at the 4:48 mark of the first round.
    Figueiredo was on the attack from the opening seconds of the fight, and after dropping Benavidez with three separate knockdowns, he secured the victory with a rear naked choke that put the four-time title contender to sleep.
